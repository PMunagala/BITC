<p>1. Test Plan and Control
<p>2. Test Analysis and Design
<p>3. Test Implementation and Execution
<p>4. Evaluating Exit Criteria and Reporting
<p>5. Test Closure Activities
<p><h3>1. Test Plan and Control:</h3> STLC process starts with test plan and control. In this Test lead Category people defines an overall approach followed by testers. Test plan is defined as an overall document providing direction for all testing activity.

<p><b>Test plan content as per IEEE 829 </b>
<p>&bull;	Test plan Identifier
<p>&bull;	Test items
<p>&bull;	Features to be tested
<p>&bull;	Features not to be tested
<p>&bull;	Test approach
<p>&bull;	Item pass/fail Criteria
<p>&bull;	Test deliverables/test ware/test artifacts
<p>&bull;	Testing tasks
<p>&bull;	Environmental needs
<p>&bull;	Roles & Responsibilities
<p>&bull;	Staffing & Training needs
<p>&bull;	Schedule
<p>&bull;	Risks, Contingencies and mitigation plan
<p>&bull;	Approvals
<p><b>Test Control:</b>
<p>It involves controlling and measuring the progress of the project against the plan. 
It is an ongoing activity. The Actual progress is monitored against the planned progress and deviations if any are highlighted. 
It has following major tasks 
<p>&bull;	Measure and analyze the results of reviews & testing
<p>&bull;	Monitor and document progress, test coverage & exit criteria
<p>&bull;	Initiative corrective actions
<p>&bull;	Make decisions
<p>&bull;	Adjust the test schedule

			
<p><b>2) Test Analysis & Design:</b> Test Analysis & Design is the activity where general testing objectives are transformed into tangible test conditions and test designs.
In this phase, we take general testing objectives identified during planning and build test designs and test procedures
<p>Step1: Reviewing on the test basis
<p>Step 2: Evaluating testability
<P>Step 3: Identify Test Conditions
<p>Step4: Design Test cases
<p>Step5: Setup test data
<p>Step6: Setup Test Environment
<p>Step7: Create traceability Matrix
<p>Reviewing on the test basis: This is the criteria for verification requirements. They are involving in reviewing the following factors
<p>&bull;	Completeness
<p>&bull; Correctness
<p>&bull;	Consistency
<p>&bull;	Necessity
<p>&bull;	Testability
<p>&bull;	Feasibility
<p>&bull;	Traceability
<p>&bull;	Feasibility
<p>&bull;	Testability
<p>&bull;	Unambiguous
<p>&bull;	Prioritization

<p>Evaluating testability: During this testers are analyzing the testing concepts and contents of the project and determine each O/P requirements output programmatically.

<p>Identify test Conditions: During this testers are preparing Test Scenario&rsquo;s & test Conditions for requirements.

<p>Test Scenario: It Summarizes functionality of the application without providing the steps to be followed. It is high level document that describes what to do? 
Inputs for preparing Test Scenario&rsquo;s are<p>
i) BRS or SRS<p>
ii) prototypes (Screenshots)<p>

<p><b>Design test Cases:</b> During this phase testers are deciding or using Test decision techniques to prepare test data or Test cases to avoid Exhaustive testing which is Impractical

<p><h3>What is a Test Case?</h3>
<p> A test case is a set of conditions or variables and inputs that are developed for a particular goal or objective to be achieved on a certain application to judge its capabilities or features. 
It might take more than one test case to determine the true functionality of the application being tested. Every requirement or objective to be achieved needs at least one test case. 
Some software development methodologies like Rational Unified Process (RUP) recommend creating at least two test cases for each requirement or objective; one for performing testing through positive perspective and the other through negative perspective. Test Case Structure A formal written test case comprises of three parts -
<p>1. Information Information consists of general information about the test case. Information incorporates Identifier, test case creator, test case version, name of the test case, purpose or brief description and test case dependencies.
<p>2. Activity Activity consists of the actual test case activities. Activity contains information about the test case environment, activities to be done at test case initialization, activities to be done after test case is performed, step by step actions to be done while testing and the input data that is to be supplied for testing.
<p>3. Results Results are outcomes of a performed test case. Results data consist of information about expected results and the actual results.

<p><b>Setup test Data:</b> During this testers Identify necessary test data to support test conditions and test cases
Test Data: The data that could be used during testing that application. They are of two types

                                                         1. Master Data
                                                         2. Temporary or Duplicate data
<p><b>Setup Test Environment: </b>During this testers Setup test Environment and Identify any Required Infrastructure and tools

Create Traceability Matrix: In the software development life cycle, requirements are translated into specifications based on which code is developed. Once the construction process is complete,
the product is finally put through various stages of testing before it finally goes live.
<p><b>Requirement Traceability Matrix:</b> Requirement tracing is the process of documenting the links between the user requirements for the system and the work products developed to implement and verify those requirements
<p><h3>How to Draft a Requirements Traceability Matrix</h3><p> 
Requirement traceability matrices are often used to determine whether the requirements of the ongoing project are being met or not. An RTM is also used to create a Request for Proposal, project plan tasks and deliverables documents. 
Let‟s take a look at the typical steps involved in drawing up a requirements traceability matrix. 
<p>&bull; Draft a template depending upon your project requirements. You can take the help of many free RTM templates that are available online. 
<p>&bull; Take all the required data from your business requirements catalog and transfer it to the template. 
<p>&bull; Mark each requirement with a different identification sign and put each sign against the corresponding requirement. 
<p>&bull; Include the use case ID into the requirements traceability matrix if you have made use of them while developing the requirements.
<p>&bull; Incorporate the System Requirements Specification ID in the RTM even though you yourself haven‟t created them. 
<p>&bull; Appropriately include the testing data into the requirement traceability matrix in such a way that the different types of tests and changes made in the project gets accounted for. 
<p>&bull; Run a double check to see if your RTM shows each specific deliverable requirement right from the point of conception throughout the entire testing phase.

<p><b>STLC- Test Implementation:</b>
<p>During Test Implementation the test conditions are converted into test cases.
<p>Test Implementation involves
<p>1. Develop and prioritize test cases and create test data for those tests
<p>2. Create test suits from the test cases for efficient test execution
<p>3. Implement and verify the environment

<p><b>Test Case:</b>
A test case is defined as set of test inputs, execution conditions, and expected results developed for a particular objective, such as to exercise a particular program path or to verify compliance with a specific requirement.

<p><b>Inputs for Preparing Test Cases:</b>
1. BRS/FRS Document/Use case
2. Prototype
3. Test Scenario&rsquo;s

<p><b>Test Execution:</b>
Test Execution is the process of executing all or a selected number of test cases either by manual or automation and observing the results
<p>Levels of Test Execution
<p>Smoke Testing: The Test execution process starts with smoke testing. It is done to ensure that the build can be accepted for software testing.
<p>Comprehensive Testing: Test cases are executed either in Manual or Automation as test batches. The testers prepares the test log document with 3 types of entries i.e. Pass, Fail or blocked.
<p>Retesting: Software should be retested to confirm that the original defect has been successfully removed. It is done only for failed test cases.
<p>Regression Testing: Testing the software when it undergoes a code change that the new code has not been affected to other parts of software.
<p>Sanity Testing: It is used test small section of the application is still working after a minor change.
<p>Final Regression Testing: It is the final level of test execution. During this execution if we get any defect is called as lucky defect.
<p><b>STLC- Defect Classification</b>
<p>Defects can be classified as following:</p>
<p>&bull;	Category
<p>&bull;	Phase of origin
<p>&bull;	Severity
<p>&bull;	Priority
<p>&bull;	Type

<p>Category: Defects generally fall into the following three categories

<p>1.Wrong: The specification has been implemented incorrectly.
<p>2 Missing: A specification or wanted requirement is not in the built product.
<p>3 Extra: A requirement included into the product that was not specified.

<p><b>Defects generally involve the following:</b>
<p>&bull;	Poor programming
<p>&bull;	Poor requirements
<p>&bull;	Missing requirements
<p>&bull;	Missed defects in testing
<p>&bull;	Misinterpreted customer requests
<p>&bull;	Untested usage scenarios

<p><b>Severity:</b> Severity indicates the impact of the defect on the application functionality.
<p>&bull;	Blocker or show stopper

<p><b>Blocker or show stopper:</b> Testing cannot continue until the defect is addressed and there is no possible workaround
<p><b>Critical:</b> Testing can continue and there is possible workaround in production, but it is very difficult.
<p><b>Major:</b> Testing can continue without any difficulty and there is workaround production. But it has to be fixed before go live.
<p><b>Minor:</b> The functionality is nice to have in production, but it is not necessary to be fixed prior to go live.
<p><b>Priority:</b> It is used to indicate the precedence of the defect to be fixed
<p>High<p>
Medium <p>
Low<p>

<p><b>1) High Severity & Low Priority:</b></P>
			
		
<p>			
			
<p>There is Banking application who gives interest of Rs 2 for every 1000 Rs in account on the last day of year. Means on last day of year 31.12.YYYY the bank will deposit 2 Rs interest for every 1000rs in account. Now bank found a bug that instead of 2 Rs application giving interest of 4 Rs for every 1000 Rs in account. Means due to bug interest is going double.
This bug is high severity - Due to bug interest is going double and bank may have thousands of accounts, So it will not be profitable for bank.
But This bug is Low priority - Depositing interest is happen on last day of year so if its beginning of year like January then there is lot of time to solve this bug.

	<p><b>2) High Priority & Low Severity: </b></P>		
<p>There is Web site say "Yahoo" Everyone reminds the logo "Yahoo.com". Suppose while updating yahoo.com by mistake they updated the wrong logo with spelling mistake they updated the wrong logo with spell missing like Yaho.com. Here O is missing. It should be seen as Yahoo.com
The bug is high Priority- Yahoo.com is company logo and mistake in company logo need to resolve on high priority on high priority to keep brand, but severity is low As its just spelling mistake then impact on user is not much high.



<p><b>3) High Priority and High Severity: </b></P>	

<p>If ATM machine has bug like when user withdraw money from same bank ATM for which he is holding bank account, He is getting charges by 20 Rs per transaction which is invalid as bank policy says withdrawing money from owns bank ATM no charge will be applied.

The Bug is high priority- Is should be resolved immediately because thousands of user withdraw money per hour so it costs high
There is high Severity because bank is charging Rs 20 per transaction for own ATM which is opposite to business logic


<p>Common Types of Product test defects </p>
<p>1.	System Functionality: Impact how the application operates as a whole
<p>2.	User Interface: Impact the appearance or use of the interface
<p>3.	Integration: Impact the system’s interaction with external systems
<p>4.	Security: Impact how the application’s architecture works
<p>5.	Technical Architecture: Impact how the application’s architecture works</p>


<p><b>Defect/Bug Life Cycle:</b></p>

<p>The duration between defection of bug and closing the bug successfully is called as bug life cycle.
                    

<p><b>Defect State: </b>
<p>New: The bug is in the new state when it is detected first time. The tester logs the bug with the status as new in the defect report.
<p>Assigned: Here the bug is assigned to the developer to fix it. The development lead logs the status as Assigned as “Assigned” in the defect report
<p>Open: The developer changes the status as Open when he starts fixing the bug
<p>Fixed: Once the developer fixes the bug, he changes the status as ‘fixed’, which is reviewed by the development lead and it is forwarded to the test lead.
<P>Retest: The test lead changes the status as ‘Retest’ and sends it back to the tester to retest to check whether the bug is fixed 
<P>Closed: The tester checks whether the bug is fixed or not. If yes then the status is changed to closed.
<P>Reopen: If bug is not fixed, the tester changes the status to Reopen
<P>Rejected:  The test lead reviews the bug and if the bug is not valid then the state is changed to rejected.
<p>Detected By: Name of the tester who detected/reported the bug.
<p>Assigned To: Name of the developer who is supposed to fix the bug. Generally this field contains the name of developer group leader, who then delegates the task to member of his team, and changes the name accordingly.
<p>Bug ID: This is a unique ID i.e. number created for the bug at the time of reporting, which identifies the bug uniquely.
<p>Description: Detailed description of the bug. This generally includes the steps that are involved in the test case and the actual results. At the end of the summary, the step at which the test case fails is described along with the actual result obtained and expected result. 
<p>Summary: This field contains some keyword information about the bug, which can help in minimizing the number of records to be searched.

<p><h3>What is a bug/error?</h3> 
<p>A bug or error in software product is any exception that can hinder the functionality of either the whole software or part of it. 
<p><h3>How do I find out a BUG/ERROR?</h3> 
<p>Basically, test cases/scripts are run in order to find out any unexpected behavior of the software product under test. If any such unexpected behavior or exception occurs, it is called as a bug.

<p><b>Adhoc Testing:</b> It is an informal testing type with an aim to break the system. The testing is usually an unplanned activity. It does not follow any test design techniques to create test cases.</p>

<p><b>Monkey Testing:</b> Randomly testing the product or Application without test cases with a goal to break the system.</p>
<p><b>Buddy Testing: </b>Two buddies mutually work on identifying defects in the same module. </p>
Mostly one buddy will be form development team and another person will be from testing team.
Buddy testing helps the testers develop better test cases and development team can also design changes early. 
This testing usually happens after unit testing completion.

<p><b>Adhoc Testing-styles</b>
<p><b>Exploratory Testing or Specification Driven testing:</b>The testing is useful when requirement documents are not available or partially available.
It involves investigation process which helps find more bugs then normal testing.
Uncover bugs which are normally ignored by other testing techniques. This testing purely depends on the tester skills.

<p><b>Pair Testing:</b></p>
<p>Two testers are assigned modules, share ideas and work on the same machines to find defects
One person can execute the tests and another person take notes on the findings.</p>
